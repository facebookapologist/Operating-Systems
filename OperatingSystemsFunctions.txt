One operating system function is the power control and its options. A device can be turned on using the power button, and there are various power modes. Besides just being on or off, a device can enter into sleep mode (where it closes non-essential functions and preserves power) or hibernate mode (where it saves current work/open software on the device and turns off power). 
Another operating system function is the user account. This sets up a specific account for a single user under a user ID or username. This can also be password protected for security and privacy.
Another operating system function is the ordering of tasks. When printing multiple documents, for example, an OS keeps track of the printing queue, which is stored on a server in buffers and released as they print.
